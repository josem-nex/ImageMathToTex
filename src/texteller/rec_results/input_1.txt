\begin{array}{l} I. NTRODUC-TON\\ \\ This Path integral formalsm for Classical Mechanics (CP)) was originally formulated in 1889 in Ref. [1]\\ where the intersided mater can find all the details omited in the present account. The ideal originalled from\\ the fact that whenever a theory has an operational formulation, it must also possess a corresponding path\\ integral. Now Classical Mechanics (CM) does have an operatotal formulation which was proposed long ape\\ by Moopman and von-Neumann [2]. This operational apptoach describes the time-evolution of phase-space\\ distributions \rho(\phi,\cdot) , by means of the Liouville operator. \tilde{L}=\ \omega^{\rm m}\mathbb{A}\mathbb{N}\ \tilde{\theta}_{\rm e}\ \left(\omega^{\rm m}\ =symplectic matrix\right) and the\\ comsponding Liouville equation.\end{array}\newline \begin{array}{l} \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\rho(\varphi,t)=\tilde{L} \rho(\varphi,t) \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad (1)\\ where \varphi=(q, p) represents the coordinate of the system in the phase space M. Therefore, it is reasonable to\\ bok for a corresponding path integral formulation and the strategy to follow is described in the max Section.\end{array}
